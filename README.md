# About the Project

## Background

This project can be considered to be the first part of a longer-term initiative by PFC to transition from a pure manually operated data capture system to one that can be operated on a networked computer system. In order to realize this, a software that can create standardized uniform form templates was needed. However, while there are many form builder software that can be obtained at little to no cost, the need to ensure strict internal control over the flow of information meant that a proprietary solution was needed.

&nbsp;

## Solution

PFC Form Builder is an online proprietary form-builder that allows users to create custom documents in a secure and convenient environment. At the touch of a few buttons, users can produce documents all customized to their needs. Compared to other form-builder software, **PFC Form Builder is designed from the ground up with the needs of PFC**

- namely security

- and information control

in mind.

**Additional Information**

More information on the analysis, design, and construction of the application can be found in the TAC Technical Report.
